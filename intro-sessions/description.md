Introduction to Programming for Beginners
===
## What is it?
Hackers at Cambridge are happy to present Introduction to Programming for Beginners! 

If you've ever wondered what programming is about, heard your friends are coding and want to get into the game or are simply just looking for a chance to learn something new, this is your chance!

Come join us to learn, ask questions and leave empowered. 

## Layout
This beginners series will start with a session on 18th October in the Judge Business School and continue with a second session on the 23rd. 
After these two sessions, you will have a good understanding of the basic concepts of programming, and we will continue with 3 workshops where you will put these newly learnt skills to practice.

You'll see how you can build a simple 'to-do' application, make a tiny snake game and ultimately understand what's going on behind the scenes of those mystical computers!
